# sql-zoo-solns
An archive of my solutions for the SQL exercises on sqlzoo.net

## About
[sqlzoo.net](sqlzoo.net) is a wonderful resource to learn SQL and practice writing queries in an interactive environment. Think a low-profile LeetCode for SQL. I have no affiliation with the website, but found great value in various lessons.

Since solutions aren't available anywhere on the site (AFAIK) and they aren't saved anywhere after submitting, I decided to post all my successful queries here for reference.

Cheers,<br>
